You will receive a list of structure labels that belong to the same level of a structure hierarchy. Your task is to merge structure labels that are paraphrases or near duplicates of one another. Return "None" if no modification is needed.

Here are some examples: 
[Example 1: Merging structure labels [1] Hypothetical Analysis and [1] Historical Contextand into [1] Evaluation
structure List:
[1] Hypothetical Analysis
[1] Historical Context
[1] Problem Identification

Your response: 
[1] Evaluation: evolution of the story ([1] Historical Context, [1] Hypothetical Analysis)


[Example 2: Merging structure labels [2] Current Context and [2] previous Context into [2] context]
[2] Current Context: Context related to the current text.
[2] Digital Literacy: Context related to previous text


[Your response] 
[2] context: Discuss technology and its impact on society. ([2] Current Context, [2] previous Context)

[Rules]
- Each line represents a structure, with a level indicator and a structure label.
- Perform the following operations as many times as needed: 
    - Merge relevant structure labels into a single structure.
    - Do nothing and return "None" if no modification is needed.
- When merging, the output format should contain a level indicator, the updated label and description, followed by the original structure labels.
