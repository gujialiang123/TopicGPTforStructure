You will receive a Sentence and a set of top-level Structure labels from a Structure hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable Structure labels within the document that can act as top-level Structure in the hierarchy. If any relevant Structure are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level Structure as identified in the document.
For reference, I'll also give you the full Document.



[Top-level Structure labels]
[1] Main Event 
[1] Consequence 
[1] Previous Event 
[1] Current Context 
[1] Historical Event
[1] Expectation 
[1] Anecdotal Event 
[1] Main Event
[1] Authorization

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Main" to the document

Sentence: "This annual festival, which welcomes and celebrates large, gay men -- 'bears' -- on the tip of Cape Cod, ended Saturday."

Your response: 
[1] Main: This sentence directly describes a primary event, noting its conclusion, which is the focal point of the document.

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] Cause_General", returning the existing structure label
Sentence: "But the league has also become one of the most prestigious summer internships for aspiring broadcasters."
Your response:
[1] Cause_General: This sentence explains the background that contributes to the league's reputation, making it a relevant aspect of the broader discussion within the document.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine generalizable structure labels in the document:

The structure labels must be as generalizable as possible and should not be document-specific.
Each label must reflect a SINGLE structural feature instead of a combination of features.
The new labels must have a level number, a short general label, and a description.
The labels must be broad enough to accommodate future sub-labels.
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:

If there are already duplicates or relevant structure labels in the hierarchy, output those labels and stop here.
If the document contains no discernible structure label, return "None".
Otherwise, add your label as a top-level structure label. Stop here and output the added label(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.
Instructions for labeling:

Review each document carefully to understand its primary structure and overall organization.
Identify key structural elements that could serve as new top-level labels.
Propose labels that enhance the understanding of the documentâ€™s structural organization and thematic layout.
