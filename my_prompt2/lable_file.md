[1] Main Event (Count: 1): The major subject of the news report. It can be the most recent event that gave rise to the news report, or, in the case of an analytical news report, it can be a general phenomenon, a projected event, or a subject.
[1] Consequence (Count: 1): An event or phenomenon that is caused by the main event or that directly succeeds the main event.
[1] Previous Event (Count: 1): A specific event that occurred shortly before the main event. It either directly caused the main event, or provides context and understanding for the main event.
[1] Current Context (Count: 1): The general context or worldstate immediately preceding the main event, to help the readers better understand and contextualize the main event. Similar to Previous Event, but not necessarily tied to a specific event.
[1] Historical Event (Count: 1): An event occurring more than 2 weeks prior to the main event. Might still impact or cause the main event, but is more distal.
[1] Expectation (Count: 1): An analytical insight into future consequences or projections made by the journalist.
[1] Evaluation (Count: 1): A summary, opinion or comment made by the journalist on any of the other discourse components.
[1] Anecdotal Event (Count: 1): Sentences describing events that are anecdotal, such events may happen before or after main events. Anecdotal events are specific events with specific participants. They may be uncertain and canâ€™t be verified. A primary purpose of this discourse role is to provide more emotional resonance to the main event.
