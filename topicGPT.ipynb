    "This notebook will run TopicGPT's scripts to generate a list of level-1/2 concepts/topics from text and can assign this list of concepts to other texts. This notebook also fits a simple logistic regression model for testing baseline concept accuracy. Importantly, we have changed topicGPT's scripts to use the open-source Llama-3 model instead of GPT-4.\n",

    "1. Setup topicGPT using their README: https://github.com/chtmp223/topicGPT/tree/main. (Note that all scripts are already included in this topicGPT directory. Just install the requirements and read through the README to understand how data and prompts can be formatted in those respective folders.)\n",
