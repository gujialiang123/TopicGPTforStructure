For five years she has organised monthly ceremonies in a park overlooking Lake Bracciano where a statue of the Virgin Mary sits in a glass case. The statue was bought by Scarpulla, known to her followers as Gisella Cardia, at a Catholic pilgrimage site in Medjugorje, Bosnia. Upon returning to  Italy, she claimed the Madonna made apparitions, wept tears of blood and was communicating messages to her. Marco Salvi, a local bishop, last week urged pilgrims to stop flocking to the site on the third of each month while his diocese investigates the phenomena surrounding the statue. Many people prayed before the statue in search of cures for serious illnesses. Scarpulla is facing a judicial investigation after a private investigator alleged that the blood stains on the statue came from a pig, and after some of her followers claimed they had been scammed. Scarpulla, who in the past had been convicted of bankruptcy fraud, created a foundation through which she collected donations, which she reportedly said would go towards setting up a centre for sick children. One man told La Repubblica that he and his wife had donated \u20ac123,000 (\u00a3106,000) to her foundation. \u201cWe were both ill, we trusted her, it was a clamorous error,\u201d he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address  Sign up Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
